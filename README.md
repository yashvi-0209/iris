# Iris Species Classification

A simple machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species based on their physical features. Uses Python, scikit-learn, and visualizes results with seaborn and matplotlib.

*Dataset*
Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features each:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The goal is to predict the species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Features
- Data exploration and visualization using seaborn pairplots
- Data preprocessing with train-test split and feature scaling
- Logistic Regression classification model
- Performance evaluation with classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy score
- Confusion matrix visualization
