# iris species classification

builds a simple machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species based on their physical features. It uses Python, scikit-learn, and visualizes results with seaborn and matplotlib.

Dataset
The famous Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features each:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

The goal is to predict the species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Features
Data exploration and visualization using seaborn pairplots

Data preprocessing with train-test split and feature scaling

Logistic Regression classification model

Performance evaluation with classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy score

Confusion matrix visualization
